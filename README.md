# The Greek Plan: ~~Eastern~~ Roman Empire Restored

This alternative history mod envisions a world
where Catherine the Great's [Greek Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Plan) triumphed, reshaping the outcome of the [Eastern Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_question)

Following the decisive Russian victory at the [Siege of Izmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Izmail), the [Treaty of Jassy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Jassy) was never signed, fueling the [Souliote War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souliote_War_(1789%E2%80%931793)) and enabling Russia to push the Ottomans out of Europe. In 1795, this led to the restoration of the ~~Eastern~~ Roman Empire.

At game start in 1836, the Empire stands reborn but locked in a fierce struggle to drive the Ottomans from Anatolia.

# Alternate History
### Inflection Point
Treaty of Jassy, which historically ended the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792), was never signed as a consequence of the the Russian victory at the Siege of Izmail, instead, this outstanding Russian Victory further fueled the Souliote War which gained momentum spreading further in the Balkans, with Russian support growing among Orthodox Christians. Thus the Russian Empire continued to war with the Ottomans, giving them time to push the Ottomans out of Europe, leading to the success of the Greek Plan. This scenario reshapes key diplomatic dynamics in Europe.

**Key Events Leading to the Inflection**:
- _Russian Persistence_: Despite the Austrian withdrawal from the war after the Treaty of Sistova (1791), Russia chooses to continue fighting. Catherine the Great, driven by her Greek Plan and the strategic importance of controlling the Bosphorus, presses forward with her ambitions.
- _Ottoman Defeats_: The Ottoman Empire suffers heavy losses, further weakening its hold on European territories like the Balkans and Constantinople. Russian forces, emboldened by successive victories, manage to capture Constantinople earlier than in our timeline,  by 1795.
- _No European Intervention_: Unlike the historical timeline where Austria and Britain preferred to preserve the Ottoman Empire to maintain the balance of power, in this mod, the European powers are too distracted by the early rumblings of revolution in France and their own internal issues. They fail to intervene decisively, giving Russia an upper hand.

### Aftermath of the Inflection

With the fall of Constantinople and the continued decline of Ottoman power, Catherine the Great proceeds with her Greek Plan. She installs her grandson, Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich, as Emperor Konstantin Konstantinov of a restored Roman Empire in 1795.

- **Kingdom of Dacia**: Following this, Catherine partitions the Danubian Principalities, creating the _Kingdom of Dacia_ as a buffer state under Russian influence. Dacia encompasses the territories of modern-day Romania and Moldova, securing Russian control over strategic regions near the Black Sea.
- **The New Eastern Roman Empire**: The restored Roman Empire initially covers the Greek lands, Constantinople, and parts of the Balkans. The empire would still face challenges of administration and cohesion, with the population consisting of diverse ethnic and religious groups.

### Geopolitical Reactions:

- **Britain and Austria**: Though initially hesitant, Austria and Britain would eventually adjust to the new reality. Austria, having lost its influence in the Balkans, might shift its focus westward, while Britain grows more concerned about Russian access to the Mediterranean through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.
- **Ottoman Empire**: After losing European territories, the Ottoman Empire consolidates its remaining lands in Anatolia, Iraq, and its North African subjects. The weakened empire may focus on internal reforms, setting the stage for a different kind of modernization under pressure from Egypt and Tripolitania.
- **France**: The success of the Greek Plan occurs during the rise of the French Revolution. With Europe distracted by the revolutionary wars, Russia takes full advantage of the power vacuum.

### Game Dynamics in 1836

By the time the game starts in 1836, the Eastern Roman Empire is already a well-established entity, but it is still at war with the Ottomans. The empire controls Constantinople and much of the Balkans, though ethnic tensions, religious divisions, and the complex administration of newly acquired territories will challenge the stability of the restored empire. The war with the Ottomans could be seen as a final attempt by the sultans to reclaim their lost European lands.

Meanwhile, the Russians, having already pushed the Ottomans out of Europe, are not directly involved in the conflict but could act as allies or future rivals to the Roman Empire, depending on how the player wants to steer the narrative.

This inflection point offers a rich set of diplomatic and military challenges for players, emphasizing the struggle to maintain the restored Roman Empire's newfound power while navigating the volatile balance of European powers.
