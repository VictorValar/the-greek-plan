# Eastern Question

In [diplomatic history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_history "Diplomatic history"), the **Eastern question** was the issue of the political and economic instability in the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") from the late 18th to early 20th centuries and the subsequent strategic competition and political considerations of the European [great powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power "Great power") in light of this. Characterized as the "[sick man of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_man_of_Europe "Sick man of Europe")", the relative weakening of the empire's military strength in the second half of the eighteenth century threatened to undermine the fragile [balance of power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_power_(international_relations) "Balance of power (international relations)") system largely shaped by the [Concert of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_of_Europe "Concert of Europe"). The Eastern question encompassed myriad interrelated elements: Ottoman military defeats, Ottoman institutional insolvency, the ongoing Ottoman political and economic modernization programme, the rise of ethno-religious nationalism in its provinces, and Great Power rivalries.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_question#cite_note-1) In an attempt to triangulate between these various concerns, the historian Leslie Rogne Schumacher has proposed the following definition of the Eastern Question:

> The "Eastern Question" refers to the events and the complex set of dynamics related to Europe's experience of and stake in the decline in political, military and economic power and regional significance of the Ottoman Empire from the latter half of the eighteenth century to the formation of modern Turkey in 1923.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_question#cite_note-2)

The period in which the Eastern Question was internationally prominent is also open to interpretation. While there is no specific date on which the Eastern question began, the [Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_(1828%E2%80%9329) "Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)") brought the issue to the attention of the European powers, Russia and Britain in particular. As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire was believed to be imminent, the European powers engaged in a power struggle to safeguard their military, strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains.  [Imperial Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Russia "Imperial Russia") stood to benefit from the [decline of the Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "Decline of the Ottoman Empire"); on the other hand, [Austria-Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary "Austria-Hungary") and [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland") deemed the preservation of the Empire to be in their best interests. The Eastern question was put to rest after the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), one of the outcomes of which was the [collapse and division of the Ottoman holdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "Collapse of the Ottoman Empire").
