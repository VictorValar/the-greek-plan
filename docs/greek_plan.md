The **Greek Plan** or **Greek Project** ([Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"): Греческий проект) was an early solution to the [Eastern question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_question "Eastern question") which was advanced by [Catherine the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_the_Great "Catherine the Great") in the early 1780s. It envisaged the partition of the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") between the [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire") and [Habsburg Empires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_monarchy "Habsburg monarchy") followed by the restoration of the [Eastern Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire "Eastern Roman Empire") centered in [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople "Constantinople").

Like her predecessors, Catherine concerned herself with the Orthodox Christians under Ottoman rule; she sponsored the [Orlov Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlov_Revolt "Orlov Revolt") in the [Morea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morea "Morea") during the [Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_of_1768%E2%80%931774 "Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774"), and invited many Greeks like [Ioannis Varvakis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioannis_Varvakis "Ioannis Varvakis") to settle in Russia, mainly in [Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea "Crimea") and [New Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novorossiya "Novorossiya"). She conceived that one of her grandsons, appropriately named [Constantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_Pavlovich "Constantine Pavlovich"), would become the first emperor of the restored Byzantium. Another important consideration was Russia's goal of free access to the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea") through the [Bosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosphorus "Bosphorus"), which the Ottomans controlled.
For this plan to succeed, the Great European Powers would need to agree to it and the Danube powers to cooperate. In May 1780, Catherine arranged a secret meeting with [Joseph II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor"), the Holy Roman Emperor, in [Mogilyov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogilyov "Mogilyov"). In a series of letters from September 1781, Catherine and Joseph discussed their plans to partition the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") and restore the [Byzantine Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire"). The [Austro-Russian alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Russian_alliance_(1781) "Austro-Russian alliance (1781)") was formalized in May 1781.

The Greek Plan was masterminded by [Prince Potemkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Potemkin "Prince Potemkin") who gave Greek names to the newly founded towns in [New Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Russia "New Russia") (e.g., [Odessa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa "Odessa") and [Kherson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kherson "Kherson")). Byzantine symbolism was highlighted in new churches such as [Kherson Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Catherine%27s_Cathedral,_Kherson "St. Catherine's Cathedral, Kherson"). Another meeting of the Russian and Austrian monarchs was arranged as part of Catherine's [Crimean journey of 1787](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_journey_of_Catherine_the_Great "Crimean journey of Catherine the Great"). Both countries [declared war on the Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_(1787%E2%80%931792) "Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)") later that year. Joseph's death in 1790, followed by the [Treaty of Jassy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Jassy "Treaty of Jassy") and the [Treaty of Sistova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Sistova "Treaty of Sistova"), in which Austria gained little, effectively ended the agreement. Austrian and European interests also had moved westward with the beginning of the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution") in 1789 which would occupy European affairs and alliances until the eventual fall of Napoleon in 1815. The new Concert of Europe was more concerned with maintaining the territorial integrity of the nations that occupied the Balkan peninsula.
