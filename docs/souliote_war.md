The **Souliote War** was an armed conflict between [Ali Pasha of Ioannina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Pasha_of_Ioannina "Ali Pasha of Ioannina") and a coalition of [Souliotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souliotes "Souliotes") and their Muslim allies. The war lasted between February 1789 and April 1793 and was fought in the context of the [Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_(1787%E2%80%931792) "Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)") and local power struggles. The Souliotes achieved a defensive victory but their actions did not foment a Christian insurrection as the Russians had hoped.
